# Model Checking of Battery-Powered Railway Lines

## Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing modeling proficiency by constructing a comprehensive model for electrified railway lines. The primary aim is to optimize train recharging schedules to mitigate operational delays, ensuring efficient and reliable railway operations.

## Project Highlights
* Model Construction: The core objective of this project is to create a robust model for electrified railway lines. This model encompasses various aspects of the railway system, including train recharging schedules, to improve overall efficiency.

* Precise Program Specification: Hoare's method is employed to ensure precise program specification and verification. This approach facilitates a systematic understanding of the system's behavior, enabling precise analysis.

* Timed Petri Nets and Temporal Logic: Timed Petri nets and temporal logic are used for a comprehensive system assessment. These tools provide a structured way to analyze real-time dynamics within the railway system.

* Uppaal Tool: The project leverages the Uppaal tool to formulate Networks of Timed Automata (NTAs). This powerful tool enables systematic analysis, design, and verification of the railway system's behavior, with a primary focus on real-time dynamics and scheduling.

* Formal Verification Techniques: The project utilizes formal verification techniques to rigorously analyze the system. These techniques are crucial for evaluating the system's key configurations and validating its critical properties, ensuring robust performance and reliability.
